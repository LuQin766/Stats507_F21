## Stats 507, Fall 2021

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jbhender/Stats507_F21/HEAD)

This is a github repository which I will used to share code
and notebooks with students in Stats 507.

The primary page for this course, including static versions of slides, is available at
[jbhender.github.io/Stats507/F21](jbhender.github.io/Stats507/F21).

### Notebooks

The folder [nb](./nb) collects notebooks from the course, including lecture slides.
Lecture slides are included both in the markdown `.md` format I authored them in and
an associated `.ipynb` format viewable without [jupytext][jupy] enabled.

in the [ps](./ps) folder.

### Binder

[Binder].  You can ignore these.
